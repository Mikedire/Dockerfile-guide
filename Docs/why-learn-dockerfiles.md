Why Learn Dockerfiles?
Dockerfiles are foundational to containerization and are a critical skill for DevOps engineers. Hereâ€™s why learning them is essential:

1. Portability Across Environments
With a Dockerfile, you can build an image once and run it anywhere. It eliminates the "works on my machine" problem.
2. Simplified CI/CD Pipelines
Automate building, testing, and deploying applications using Dockerfiles in CI/CD pipelines like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps.
3. Version Control for Infrastructure
Just like code, Dockerfiles can be version-controlled. Changes in infrastructure can be tracked and rolled back if necessary.
4. Enhanced Collaboration
Teams can share Dockerfiles to ensure everyone works in the same environment. It simplifies onboarding for new developers or contributors.
5. Resource Efficiency
Docker images created with optimized Dockerfiles are lightweight and consume fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines.
