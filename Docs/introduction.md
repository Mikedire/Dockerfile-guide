What is a Dockerfile?
A Dockerfile is a plain text file that contains a series of instructions used to build a Docker image. Each line in a Dockerfile represents a step in the image-building process. The image created is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environment containing everything needed to run an application, including libraries, dependencies, and the application code itself.

Key Components of a Dockerfile:
Base Image: The starting point for your Docker image. For example, if you're building a Python application, you might start with python:3.9 as your base image.
Application Code and Dependencies: The code is added to the image, and dependencies are installed to ensure the application runs correctly.
Commands and Configurations: Instructions to execute commands, set environment variables, and expose ports.
